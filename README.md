# Iyrin
Iyrin is a basic server monitoring facility to keep web hosting providers honest. It simply pings itself every minute and keeps the result in a mysql database. It has a (basic) frontend which shows the recent uptime and recent incidents. 

# Installation
Simply upload to your server and edit the config file to connect to a free database.
